1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,100
There we go. We're
recording now. Hi everyone.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,379
Welcome to the First Healthy,

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,120
R clinic of 2024.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,299
Hope everyone had a really
nice festive season

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,120
and is looking forward
to the New Year.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,380
Today we're going to be doing
our demo on venn diagrams,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,719
which is a requested demo.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,800
If anyone ever has any requests

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,639
of topics they'd
like us to cover,

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,690
I like to try and tailor

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,510
the clinics to things
that people actually

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,929
find useful and helpful

13
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:37,249
and might help their
day to day life.

14
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,550
We really appreciate requests.

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,830
Today you've got Neil with me
who is sharing his screen.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,669
This is just IDE or
R studio interface

17
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:54,950
on Posit Cloud link
is in the chat,

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,709
it just shows us right now
it's the three panels.

19
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,509
But if you open up

20
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,230
the R markdown document that's

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,049
called one underscore venn

22
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,889
yes that one there we'll

23
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,510
see the four panels that
we're used to seeing.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:18,329
The top left is the bottom
left is the console top right,

25
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,250
our environment where our

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,989
import imported
datasets will end up.

27
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,770
And then the bottom
right is where

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,849
all our scripts and
files are saved.

29
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,389
A few other tabs that
do different things,

30
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:37,130
but they are less
important Right now,

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,669
Neil has opened up the
R markdown document,

32
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:44,970
which is a place
where we can type

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,250
our code and also free text.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,809
It's made up of a few things.

35
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,050
It's got the yaml
at the very top,

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,749
where is where you set
a bunch of metadata.

37
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,350
Things like the title
of the document,

38
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,970
the author, the date,

39
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,534
and lots of other different
customisable options.

40
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,739
Then we've got this
grayed out section

41
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,059
which is code chunk.

42
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:15,280
It's in the grade sections
that we type our R code.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,800
And then in the white sections

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,599
where we can write free text.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,179
Don't scroll right
to the bottom of

46
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,759
the document because I have

47
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,719
some answers just in

48
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,960
case we want to have
a check of those.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,080
But can you make

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,679
the script quadrant a

51
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,619
bit bigger and
then maybe zoom in

52
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,340
slightly to make the
text slightly bigger?

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,899
Hey, is it okay?

54
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:55,939
Yeah, that looks good
If you scroll down,

55
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,079
if you just run the
data prep chunk that

56
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:06,900
I've made which has the packages
that we're going to use,

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,419
then just a few little bits.

58
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,680
Tidy verse is a package
that we frequently use,

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
really good for data
data wrangling.

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,679
You can see there all
the packages that it

61
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:25,900
loads in table Tidlist,

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,570
cetera, M. Then there

63
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,389
was a GG Ven package
that we're going to be

64
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:34,290
using for making our
ven diagrams today.

65
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,889
Janitor is just one

66
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,790
that I've used for this
clean names function,

67
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,709
which is just a
quick way to remove

68
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,189
special characters
and spaces from

69
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,909
your column headings to
make it a bit cleaner,

70
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,369
Upset R is something that
we're going to demonstrate

71
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:58,874
at the end when venn diagrams
get a bit complicated.

72
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:04,859
Excellent. Neil,
could you start off,

73
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,840
we've got a fresh dataset.

74
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,319
Don't know much about it.

75
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,340
Would you be able to open

76
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,959
up the dataset,
have a look at it,

77
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,479
and then maybe try
doing a few counts

78
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,360
on obesity, smoking, diabetes.

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,399
I should say quickly,

80
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,599
this is a dataset found online

81
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,579
from the tidy Tuesday database,

82
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,999
which is just made

83
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:39,620
it a really cool

84
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,060
location to get lots of

85
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,700
online datasets to practise
your coding skills.

86
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,280
This is just looking at

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,640
like a heart health
database kind of thing.

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,640
And I've just filtered
for 5,000 observations.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,420
So yeah, sorry, rambling.

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,919
Now over to you if you can.

91
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,380
So what I always like to do is

92
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,200
just click on the
dataset and just have,

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,400
have a look at the visual

94
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,279
just to get a feel
for what's there.

95
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,820
So I can see we've got 26
columns here, 5,000 rows.

96
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,259
We've got patient ID,

97
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,939
some demographic information,

98
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:26,080
cholesterol measures of
blood pressure, heartbreak.

99
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,960
Family, history, smoking.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,360
Okay. All kinds of information.

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,670
Stress level. Is that
like a self assessed?

102
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,710
General life stress measure.

103
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,870
Good question. I'm not sure.

104
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,989
Yeah, I guess it's
maybe self assessed.

105
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:56,090
I didn't quite learn about

106
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,509
how the variables were made.
I wonder what it means.

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:07,250
Okay, Someone's getting nine
out 10 hours sleep a day.

108
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,230
Look at them, what's
their stress level?

109
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,709
Stress level seven.

110
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,310
Okay. All right.

111
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,750
Right. Okay. So we've got all
kinds of information on it.

112
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,550
Looks like 5,000 individuals.

113
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,669
Yeah. And the reason

114
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,809
some of them are true
and false is because

115
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:41,470
I earlier in the script

116
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,549
changed it to true and false as

117
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,989
opposed to a binary one or zero.

118
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,510
Because that just makes
it much easier for

119
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,249
using the GG package.

120
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,089
But it's showing the
same kind of binary.

121
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,389
Yes. No content.

122
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,970
So we've got different
countries here,

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,670
so we could say, we could do

124
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:33,110
sort, sort that.

125
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,529
Okay. So it's quite evenly

126
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,630
distributed across
different countries.

127
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,549
So there's 200 and odd
from each country.

128
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,830
What else might
be interested in?

129
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,769
I'm going to go to that
stress level variable.

130
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:08,710
I want to see. I'm not sure

131
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,810
that it's quite evenly

132
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,069
distributed over
stress levels as well.

133
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:26,060
Yeah, what kind of

134
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,939
questions are we going
to be asking about

135
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:33,880
this data for this example?

136
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,299
These are all people that are,

137
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,300
it's information on their heart.

138
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,640
These are all people are

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,380
potentially at risk of
having a heart attack.

140
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,469
What we're going
to be looking at,

141
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02,970
what we're going to
be looking at with

142
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,569
the Venn diagrams is
plotting the co morbidities

143
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:12,749
or other symptoms that these
people are experiencing.

144
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,249
For example, we're
going to be looking

145
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,729
at whether or not
they're smokers,

146
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:20,670
alcohol intake, et cetera.

147
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,929
Just to have a visualisation of

148
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,489
the co morbidities that
these people that all have

149
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:31,649
a history of heart disease have.

150
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,529
Should I make a plot, Sarah?

151
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,929
Yeah, I think plotting
your data before

152
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,509
you try and jump

153
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,870
into anything complicated
is always really important.

154
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,250
So maybe if you try
doing a bar plot,

155
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,069
if you do heart attack risk on

156
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,709
the x axis and then fill
the colour based on

157
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,689
diabetes and then
just have a check and

158
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:18,710
then do a geom_bar and have
a look at that risk.

159
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,030
Is that right, fill, fill

160
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,690
What it was called
diabetes or just any

161
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,470
of the comorbidity variables.

162
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,610
Perfect.

163
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,230
There we are. Now we've got
a really quick plot though.

164
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,510
It's zoom out slightly.

165
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,750
It's showing us the counts

166
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,769
of heart attack risk

167
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,590
is currently viewed as
a numeric variable,

168
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,309
which is why that is giving

169
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:03,190
us a continuous scale as
opposed to just one or zero.

170
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,509
Could you change that quickly?

171
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,129
Just make it a factor?

172
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,899
So am I allowed to do that?

173
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,100
Just in here at Yeah, you can.

174
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:25,180
I what Neil is doing

175
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,919
is changing the x variable to

176
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,559
a factor as opposed
to changing it in

177
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,400
the entire dataset because
we're just caring about it.

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,939
In this quick instance,

179
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:38,979
you can just put it into the
aesthetics bracket there.

180
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,179
When you scroll down,
you'll see that it's

181
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,759
changed x axis, it's Fct,

182
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,860
but you can see that
it's now 1.0 as

183
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,060
opposed to a continuous scale,

184
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,200
which wasn't correct because

185
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,099
even though it's
1.0 we know that

186
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:58,300
that's a two level
factor, not a number.

187
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,319
As now you can see that there's

188
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,440
over 3,000 people that are not
at risk of a heart attack,

189
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,120
under 2000 people
that are at risk.

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,200
And you can just
see how the spread

191
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,279
of those patients that have

192
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,020
diabetes split between
those two patients.

193
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,560
Yeah, just like you're saying,

194
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
counts and plots are really
important thing to do at

195
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,880
the very beginning
just so that you can

196
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,940
get to grips with your data,

197
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,479
you can see if there's
any abnormalities,

198
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,779
anything that you don't
expect, et cetera.

199
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,060
Now for the sake of time,

200
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,200
we will jump into the
actual Venn diagram part

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,790
of creating this diagram,

202
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,910
the bend diagram part
of the diagram demo.

203
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,069
I hadn't made many Ben diagrams

204
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,889
in R before this
request came in.

205
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,630
Did a bit of research

206
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,349
and there are lots
of ways to do it.

207
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:08,349
There's a package
called venndiagram,

208
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,310
which is quite popular to use,

209
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,269
but I found it quite
complicated and clunky and

210
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,589
you add to input a lot
of the numbers manually.

211
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,969
Instead, we're going to
be using this function,

212
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:24,009
ggvenn, which is from
the ggvenn package.

213
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:30,489
Which flows much more nicely
into a tidy verse work flow.

214
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:32,549
But just to let you
know that there's

215
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,669
other options out there.

216
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:37,370
What we're going to
start with now, Neil,

217
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,029
is as always going to start with

218
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,530
our dataset and pipe
into the function ggvenn.

219
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,609
Yes.

220
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,009
At its basic, all you
really need to do is

221
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,049
specify the columns that

222
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,710
you want to be included
in this V diagram.

223
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:20,310
If you do columns equals and
then do a combined like a C,

224
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,829
open brackets for this
one we're going to do,

225
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,809
you can do whatever
variables you're looking

226
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,590
at but why don't we do diabetes

227
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,669
and smoking and just to see how

228
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:39,049
those two variables
overlap and then run that.

229
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,489
The variables have to
be in quotations for

230
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:50,489
this yes

231
00:14:51,290 --> 00:15:00,139
object just like that.

232
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,539
It's done all the
counting up for us.

233
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,800
It has to be in a logical format

234
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,480
which was why they were
all true and false before.

235
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,219
But that's just a really
quick and easy way

236
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,960
to get a really
simple venn diagram.

237
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,680
You can see it's got

238
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,279
the overlap and the two
numbers at the side.

239
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,620
When you say to be
a logical format,

240
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,680
does that mean that these
variables, diabetes,

241
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,640
these have to be true false
smoking To be true false,

242
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,300
it can't be 10 anything.

243
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,260
Yeah, it can't be 10,

244
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,159
even if it's viewed as a factor.

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,260
Logical format is what
you need to change it to.

246
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,160
But that's really simple.
If you scroll up slightly,

247
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,760
can I did it for us at
the very beginning here?

248
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,119
Slightly as logic,

249
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,899
it's really quick and
easy thing to do,

250
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,060
just as you would change things
to a factor or a number.

251
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,200
You can also change it to
a logical output there.

252
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,560
But yes, if you scroll
down again to the diagram,

253
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,699
this was a really quick
and easy way to do it.

254
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,259
But what I don't
like about it is

255
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,590
that the circles are equal.

256
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,489
Sizes might be a bit misleading.

257
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,529
It looks like the smokers

258
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,010
and those that have
diabetes is quite easy.

259
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,650
It doesn't look like
there's much overlap.

260
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,269
There's actually a
handy function in

261
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,569
this ggvenn package, not
function, argument

262
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:50,730
called auto underscore scale.

263
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,550
If you set auto
underscore scale to true,

264
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,929
that should help us out a bit.

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,559
There we go.

266
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,980
Now it's changed slightly.

267
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,699
It seems a lot more realistic
or visually at a glance,

268
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,619
you can see that

269
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,100
the smokers encapsulates
almost everyone

270
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,559
that is also diabetic.

271
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,620
I just think that's
a bit easier to see

272
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,759
the output as opposed to

273
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,959
the two even circles
that we had before.

274
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,980
You can change lots
of other things.

275
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,319
If you put F one on
the ggvenn function,

276
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,680
we can have a look at
some of the options,

277
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,279
but you can change
the colours and

278
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:01,239
the size of the font and
all of those things.

279
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
We're just opening up the
help document at the moment.

280
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
Just now, just to have a look at

281
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,080
all the things that we can
change in this venn diagram.

282
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,300
These are all default,

283
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,579
it's autoscale is false.

284
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,479
That's because the autoscaling

285
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:32,259
is only possible in

286
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,639
these simple venn diagrams
with two variables.

287
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,664
When it comes to more
complicated venn diagrams,

288
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:45,289
the mathematical
applicability of

289
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,570
having the correct
overlap of exact circles,

290
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,709
which is what we're plotting
here, gets too complicated.

291
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,150
You can't actually scale those.

292
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,329
I think that's why by
default it is false.

293
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,829
Why don't we have to go at

294
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:03,349
changing fill underscore colour.

295
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:07,409
Right now it's using
the blue and yellow.

296
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:12,609
But why don't we change
them to any colour?

297
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,080
We only need to give it two.

298
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,859
We dont need to give it three colours

299
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,759
because there are
three cos on the plot.

300
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,719
You need to give it two
and the middle colour,

301
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:37,140
because it's slightly
transparent,

302
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,339
like the alpha of 0.5 I

303
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,520
think it's just
overlapping those colours.

304
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,540
Brilliant. Now we've changed

305
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,000
the colours to purple and green.

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,759
You can change them
to, the opportunities

307
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,959
are pretty vast colour.

308
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,679
You can give colour
names or hex codes.

309
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,760
Try changing fill

310
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,939
Underscore alpha just so
we can have a look at

311
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:11,540
how the transparency works.

312
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,920
That middle overlap intersection

313
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,919
is just made up of a mix
of both of those colours.

314
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,460
But I think that's because
of the transparency.

315
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,360
If we make it 10

316
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,559
by default 0.51 it'll be opaque.

317
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Yes. Yeah, that doesn't do
the overlap colour as much,

318
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,159
which I think the 0.5 default is

319
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,259
probably a good shots on.

320
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,919
The green has dominated,

321
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,659
taken president, if it's
zero with the puck.

322
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,699
All right, so colour at all.

323
00:20:54,699 --> 00:21:04,159
So this is the overall.

324
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,099
Transparency of it. It's
not just the centre.

325
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,600
I guess that means the brain one

326
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,319
is being put over
the purple one.

327
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:16,440
Which is why when they
were fully colour blocked,

328
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,340
the green one was on top.

329
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,000
Makes sense.

330
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,299
Okay. Yes. That's just a
bit of a demonstration

331
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,479
that you can change
most things here.

332
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:29,759
You can change the text size,

333
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,460
you can change the colours,

334
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,639
you can change, you

335
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:36,680
can change almost anything

336
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,659
that you don't like about this.

337
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,699
And all you have to do
is add the argument

338
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,820
into your code junk.

339
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,899
Okay, let's try

340
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:55,879
three variables, okay?

341
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:59,580
Yeah, we've already pretty
much done that task there.

342
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,399
Skip that? No, no,
it's all right.

343
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,159
I was just trying to

344
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,880
formulate things in
my brain a bit more.

345
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,680
If you copy the code chunk
from task two into task four,

346
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,219
and then we can add
a third variable.

347
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,180
So that's the columns

348
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,119
she had like obesity

349
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,739
I think is the name
of the other column.

350
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,380
There we go. Just try
running that, right?

351
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,220
Yes. This is what I
was trying to mention

352
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,120
earlier that you can't
scale more than two.

353
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,139
The two venn diagram

354
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,119
looks quite nice because
you can scale it.

355
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,259
The circles are
proportional to the sample,

356
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,420
vaguely proportional
to the sample size.

357
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,740
But once you start
doing more than two,

358
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,940
it gets quite tricky.

359
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,099
We're going to have to take
out that autoscale argument.

360
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:21,480
We can't have
autoscale equals true.

361
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,200
This is the same with
the other functions

362
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,459
or the other packages that I was

363
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:31,019
looking at in how to
make venn diagrams.

364
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:33,959
The venn diagram package
also can't scale

365
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:38,279
on three or more usually.

366
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,639
What is this error?
Insufficient amount.

367
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,899
Okay. This is an
error that's come up.

368
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,899
It's quite nice to see errors.

369
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:57,759
It's basically telling
us that three is needed,

370
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,699
but only two is provided
in the manual scale.

371
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,120
This is in reference
to the colours.

372
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,980
We've given it two colours,

373
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,080
but now there's going
to be three circles.

374
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:19,069
We just have to give it
an extra colour. Perfect.

375
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,549
There we go.

376
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,109
Now we've got a Venn diagram of

377
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:30,930
our three comorbidities
and you can see

378
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,009
the overlap between
the intersection

379
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,449
between diabetes and smoking.

380
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:39,009
Smoking, obesity,
obesity, and diabetes,

381
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,629
and then also the
intersection of

382
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:43,390
all three in the middle there.

383
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,929
It's a bit trickier because you

384
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,450
can't scale the circles
to different sizes.

385
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,640
The overlap doesn't necessarily

386
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,259
match the size of the number
that it's giving you,

387
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,339
which I find a bit frustrating.

388
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,539
But when you're
using two variables,

389
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,820
it can be a nice way
to demonstrate three.

390
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,719
As long as you have
the numbers there,

391
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,240
it's not too complicated
to understand.

392
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,859
It starts getting really
hard with four variables,

393
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,719
which we can show just for

394
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:30,100
fun if you add a fourth
variable into the column.

395
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,180
If you add alcohol consumption,

396
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,579
alcohol underscore consumption.

397
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,439
And then you'll need to
add a fourth colour as

398
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:52,339
well. Any more colours.

399
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,379
Oh yeah, it gets a bit crazy.

400
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:12,100
I don't find this diagram
that useful any more.

401
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,009
Yes. Venn diagrams.

402
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:20,950
I think with two,

403
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,769
you can make some
really nice ones in

404
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:25,689
R. After that, they
get a bit tricky.

405
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,589
But now I'm going
to slightly pivot

406
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,129
the request to what
I would do if I

407
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:36,869
was trying to
visualise this data

408
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:45,009
in R. What I would do instead
was create an upset plot.

409
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,990
What does the
numbers that far out

410
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,750
that basically the question

411
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,970
is what does the
number represent?

412
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,949
Lost the chat. What does

413
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,269
the number represent
that appears

414
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:01,810
outside the diagram each time?

415
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,709
That is the patients that

416
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:09,070
don't fall into
these categories,

417
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,990
although they should
just be right.

418
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,810
Yeah, they're the ones that
are a false for everything.

419
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,210
30 patients are not
obese or smokers,

420
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,370
or diabetic or consume alcohol.

421
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,209
Yeah, it's a bit funny.

422
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:41,189
Theoretically here we
might want a circle.

423
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:43,390
Around the outside
of these are people

424
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,390
that have heart disease thing.

425
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,149
And then those 30 people
would fall into that circle,

426
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:51,069
but they don't have any
of the comorbidities

427
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,289
depending on what
you're actually

428
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:58,550
trying to visualise, right?

429
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,250
So this is not a
particularly useful diagram.

430
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,450
It could be, Yeah, I find,

431
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,969
I think upset plots would be
where I would jump to if I

432
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:15,709
was doing above three or maybe
even above two variables,

433
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,469
depending on the
type of journal or

434
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:21,210
publication or manuscript
you're trying to write.

435
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,710
If you scroll down

436
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:32,089
nesse lines of code

437
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,530
I've just written in advance,

438
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,569
I'm just creating
a new data frame

439
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,610
called Upset data from

440
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,869
our heart underscore
DF data frame.

441
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:54,189
I'm selecting the variables
I'm interested in.

442
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:57,569
I'm interested in the
column diabetes, obesity,

443
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,290
smoking, alcohol consumption,
and medication use.

444
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,970
You can imagine these five
variables in a Venn diagram.

445
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,250
There would be a lot of overlap.

446
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,089
It'd be very difficult to

447
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,549
work out what number
is representing,

448
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,270
but you might want
to have a diagram

449
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,889
that shows the patient.

450
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,429
You might want to know if

451
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,749
there's patients
that have lots of

452
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,809
these combilities or
if we're looking at

453
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,610
a dataset of people that
tend to just have one.

454
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,210
Yeah, there's just lots

455
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,529
of reasons why you
might want to have

456
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:36,409
a venn diagram style
diagram type information

457
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,650
in a different diagram.

458
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,769
One important thing to note is

459
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:48,419
that to use the upset plot,

460
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,519
you have to use this
function as.data.frame,

461
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,380
which turns it into a data
frame as opposed to a tibble,

462
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,540
which we use commonly.

463
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,719
In the tidyverse,

464
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,980
I think this is because upset,

465
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,960
the package that's coming
from is from five years ago,

466
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,200
which in Rs lifetime
is quite old, I guess.

467
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,920
It doesn't handle tibbles.

468
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,700
That's just something
to Oh yeah,

469
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,979
just there we can show
you without as a tibble.

470
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,719
And you can see the error
if that is helpful.

471
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:34,020
But it's just important
to note that sometimes

472
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,860
older packages
don't like tibbles,

473
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,579
which is a bit frustrating.

474
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,420
But yes, if you run that chunk,

475
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,559
the create the upset data.

476
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,359
Just the first part. Both parts.

477
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,639
Both lines we can do all.

478
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,680
We can talk through what the
second bit is doing as well.

479
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,989
Okay, there we go.

480
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:05,750
If you open upset data quickly,

481
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,789
just to have a look at so

482
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:10,149
everyone can see
what it looks like.

483
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,309
These are the columns
that we selected for.

484
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,789
Instead of true and false,

485
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:18,550
it's going back to
ones and zeros.

486
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,909
I did that in advance just
because it's a bit easier.

487
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,510
Upset needs ones and zeros as
opposed to trues and false.

488
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,510
That venn diagram needed,
that's what that was doing.

489
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,729
You'll notice the
column headings

490
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:42,150
are now back to having
capitals and spaces in them.

491
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,349
I'll explain why I did that.

492
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:48,369
We create an upset plot.

493
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:50,990
It's mostly just an
aesthetic thing.

494
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,869
If you go back into the
markdown document, Neil,

495
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,509
and create a new chunk and

496
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:02,730
we're we're going to
make an upset plot.

497
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,590
What you want to do is you're
using the function upset,

498
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,410
it's just upset

499
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,549
that would be upset
is the name of

500
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,250
the function that we're using
from the library upset?

501
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,550
Yeah, that's that, as you
can see in this helpful tab,

502
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,849
the things that it needs,
all you really need to

503
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:40,330
give it is the
dataset that we want.

504
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,869
If we start by doing
that upset data,

505
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:50,709
we can change some of
the aesthetics there.

506
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:54,690
If you run that, just
see what it makes.

507
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,309
There we go. Can you

508
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,310
use out slightly so we
can see it all at once?

509
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,669
This is what an upset
plot looks like.

510
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:06,290
I like to do order by

511
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,650
frequency because right
now it jumps around a lot.

512
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,489
It might actually be
easier if we add it in

513
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:15,090
the frequency order before

514
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,349
we talk through
what it's showing.

515
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,269
Yes, it's just order by

516
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:34,149
then, freq, in perfect.

517
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:37,030
And that just creates,

518
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,889
it's a bit easier to see because

519
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:43,190
the numbers are in
descending order.

520
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,290
Now, basically this is an
alternative to a Venn diagram.

521
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,430
The bars in the top
plot are counts

522
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,869
of how many individuals have

523
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:10,030
the combination described
using the lollipop things.

524
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,409
At the bottom, you'll see
that 440 people have obesity,

525
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,150
consume alcohol or
diabetic and smoke.

526
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:27,049
Then 434 take medication

527
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:30,830
for their heart,
consume alcohol,

528
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:36,530
diabetic and smoke and
so on This diagram,

529
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,069
you can see that most of

530
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:41,729
our patients have
multimorbidity.

531
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:45,309
If you can call these
co morbidities,

532
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:52,429
few patients have only
one or two combinations.

533
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,849
The reason I changed the
names of the columns early on

534
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:02,489
is that the bottom
half of the diagram,

535
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:06,970
you can see that it's
nicely formulated headings

536
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,209
as opposed to the
column headings that

537
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:12,869
would have had no
spaces and underscores.

538
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,329
Cool. I guess if

539
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,249
you go in the help tab
for the upset plot,

540
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,749
we can have a look at
some of the things that

541
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:27,209
we can customise with

542
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,349
this

543
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,330
number

544
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,990
of sets.

545
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,149
I guess that's if
you have lots of,

546
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:57,830
we only have five anyway.

547
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,729
But if you had more,

548
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:05,589
there might be some outliers
that are less informative.

549
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,930
So you might want to just reduce

550
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,629
that number, number
of intersects.

551
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,769
I think, yeah, that could be,

552
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,789
again, there might be some
outliers at the other end.

553
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:25,029
Is that 40 that we
have that like 40.

554
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,649
Anyway, you can change
the number of intersects

555
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,089
that you're interested in with

556
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:39,629
that order by frequency

557
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,969
is the main one that I do every
time I make one of these.

558
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,309
Because I think it's a bit more

559
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:48,549
informative to be able to see

560
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:50,749
that trend as opposed to

561
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:57,709
it being a bit more up
and down. Why don't we

562
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:17,740
We could change the minbar
label from intersection size.

563
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,359
We could change it
to whatever we want,

564
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,160
something like number
of patients or Yeah,

565
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,280
try number of patients.

566
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,060
Okay,

567
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:37,939
so label going

568
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:45,199
to call it number of

569
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,640
patients.

570
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,719
Let's change this.

571
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,439
Yeah, so let's change
that there so we can,

572
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,499
yeah, it doesn't have

573
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,500
to be intersection size,
which is the default.

574
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,519
You can change it to
whatever you want it to be.

575
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:16,900
Let's do one more and change
the colour of the main bars.

576
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,079
Let's do bar colour and

577
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,039
change it to whatever
colour we want.

578
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,579
When it comes to changing
all colours as a whole,

579
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,859
it's more of an
aesthetic thing as

580
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:30,539
opposed to trying to
convey information.

581
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,959
But it's sometimes
nice to have like

582
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,439
a theme of colours
that you use a lot.

583
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,700
Yeah, light blue is nice.

584
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,250
Now, those bars are blue.

585
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,409
Awesome. Yeah.

586
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,869
As you can see in the Help tab,

587
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:54,789
there's loads and those
are things that you

588
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:58,050
can do to change the point size,

589
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:04,090
line size, the numbers
that you see, the colours.

590
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,669
Yeah, I find upset plots
quite useful if you're

591
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:10,969
trying to convey diagram
like information.

592
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:13,629
But you've got too
many variables

593
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:16,289
but it gets a bit
too complicated.

594
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:18,329
Yeah.

595
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,769
Is it possible, the question,

596
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,769
is it possible to have
each colnability in

597
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:27,890
its own colour? Good question.

598
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,889
Let's see if we
can work that out.

599
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,409
If we have a look at
this is what I would do

600
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,309
or what we would do when

601
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,189
we're not sure. I've
never done that.

602
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:48,770
I would have a look
at these options.

603
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,050
I think it's set bar colour.

604
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:59,250
These are the sets. If we try
changing sets bar colours,

605
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,350
but create like a combined

606
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:06,070
and give them five
different colours,

607
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,299
see what happens, and

608
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:14,239
then we'll do fine
calls, give it a go.

609
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,839
I'm not sure if this will work.

610
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,170
Yeah. Okay. That's the bars.

611
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,370
Okay. That's those bars.

612
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,630
What other colours can we
sit if you find in topic?

613
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,150
If you search the word colour?

614
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,169
Sometimes I just like in

615
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:10,209
that one other search
box next to the,

616
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,549
although I think you'll have to

617
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,009
spell it the American way.

618
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:28,370
See what comes up?
A tribute colour?

619
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,049
It might be.

620
00:41:31,049 --> 00:41:32,409
Yeah.

621
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,030
Oh, colour

622
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,529
of the intersection
points is that.

623
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,209
Yeah, I think it's
that. Give that one

624
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:52,410
it goes matrix colour.

625
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,570
Wanted.

626
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,169
So I'll just copy this.

627
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:06,950
Yeah, just use the same colours.

628
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,590
That is not what we wanted.

629
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,830
Oh, so that's just
looking for one colour.

630
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,590
Okay. Right, that's annoying.

631
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,250
It's just taking
the first colour

632
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,069
which is orange
and made them all.

633
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,189
I think that would
be would it be

634
00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:35,810
the main bar plot if
you tried putting

635
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,069
the combined colour
list in there?

636
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,149
Is that what the
question was about

637
00:42:42,149 --> 00:42:45,630
the currently blue
bars bar colour?

638
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,749
If I put this? I don't know.

639
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,849
Yeah, we can try it.

640
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:53,909
Yeah, I think that

641
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:57,329
that's for the main bars
that are going up and down.

642
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,269
I think, yeah, that technically
or whatever number it is.

643
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,609
I think ideally each

644
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:08,910
comorbidity where
the coloured bars

645
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,369
on the left hand side are,

646
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:13,070
each of the dots would
also have that colour,

647
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,229
just to make it easier to read.

648
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:17,989
But I don't think it's
going to take that.

649
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:20,129
It's taken orange
as the first colour

650
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,869
we've given it and just
coloured them all that way.

651
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,909
It looks like the answer is no.

652
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:35,210
A colour coming to go and
change all the colours.

653
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,130
A colour colour of
attribute histogram bins

654
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,510
or scetoblock points.

655
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,669
Okay. Yeah, actually that
sounds like it could be.

656
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:58,749
Try taking out the
matrix colour one.

657
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,940
And Agnes,

658
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,560
do you mean the ones that
are currently light blue?

659
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,860
That you would like to have
them different colours?

660
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,679
Yes. Yeah, I would have
wanted to see that

661
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,340
killed in different colours

662
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,899
depending on the
number of commodities.

663
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:43,119
But it seems like there

664
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,939
can only be one colour,
so That's okay.

665
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,859
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure if
you can change that one.

666
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,319
We'd have to give it
a colour for each,

667
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:02,859
567-89-1062

668
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,869
31 colours to

669
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:12,189
make it to manually set it,

670
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:14,150
unless we can give a palette.

671
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:17,229
I think I, yes,

672
00:45:17,229 --> 00:45:20,449
I'm not quite sure, but
I can have a search.

673
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:24,550
And then before I upload
the code to this demo,

674
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,269
I can see if I can fix
it and then add that in.

675
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,869
But otherwise, does anyone
have any questions on

676
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,989
this content or

677
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:39,690
indeed any quick clinic

678
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,329
questions because
that ran on a bit.

679
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,229
Yes. I will share a link to

680
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:50,030
the previous videos on Github.

681
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,509
I'll do that right now. Right.

682
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,129
I'm going to stop the
recording and then we

683
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,949
can get any brief questions
if anyone has any.

684
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:02,249
And I'll share that
link just now.
